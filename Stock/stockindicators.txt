Investment goals: Determine your investment goals, such as long-term growth or short-term gains, and select stocks that align with those goals.

Risk tolerance: Determine your risk tolerance and select stocks that match your comfort level. Some stocks carry higher risks but also have the potential for higher returns, while others may be less risky but offer lower returns.

Time horizon: Consider your time horizon for holding the stock, whether it's short-term or long-term. Short-term investors may focus on stocks with strong momentum, while long-term investors may focus on stocks with strong fundamentals.

Diversification: Diversification is key to managing risk in a stock portfolio. Consider diversifying across sectors, industries, and asset classes to reduce risk.

Trading frequency: Determine how frequently you plan to trade stocks. Frequent trading can generate higher transaction costs and may result in short-term capital gains taxes.

Stop-loss orders: Consider setting stop-loss orders, which automatically sell your shares if they fall below a certain price. This can help limit potential losses.



Determining the risk of a stock mathematically involves calculating several financial ratios and metrics. Here are some of the key metrics used to assess the risk of a stock:

Beta: Beta measures a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 means the stock's price moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 means the stock is more volatile than the market, and a beta less than 1 means the stock is less volatile than the market.

Standard deviation: Standard deviation measures the volatility of a stock's returns. A higher standard deviation indicates greater risk.

Sharpe ratio: The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return of a stock relative to the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation of the stock's returns. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

Debt-to-equity ratio: The debt-to-equity ratio measures a company's debt relative to its equity. A higher debt-to-equity ratio indicates greater financial risk.

Price-to-earnings ratio: The price-to-earnings ratio measures the price of a stock relative to its earnings. A higher price-to-earnings ratio indicates that the market is willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings, which may indicate higher expectations for future growth.

Dividend yield: The dividend yield measures the amount of dividend income a stock provides relative to its price. A higher dividend yield indicates that the stock provides more income to investors, but it may also indicate that the company is less likely to reinvest earnings in growth opportunities.

These metrics can provide a mathematical assessment of a stock's risk, but it's important to remember that investing always involves risk and there is no guarantee of returns. It's important to conduct your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.



The beta of a stock measures its volatility relative to the overall market. To calculate the beta of a stock, you need to obtain the following information:

Historical price data for the stock: You can obtain this data from financial websites or databases such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg.

Historical market index data: You need to obtain data for the market index that you want to use as a benchmark. The most common benchmark is the S&P 500 index, which represents a broad cross-section of the U.S. equity market.

Once you have obtained the historical price data for the stock and the market index, you can calculate the beta of the stock using the following formula:

Beta = Covariance(stock returns, market returns) / Variance(market returns)

where Covariance is the measure of how much two variables move together, and Variance is the measure of how much a single variable deviates from its mean.

To simplify the calculation, you can use regression analysis to determine the beta of a stock. You can use software tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, or statistical software such as R or Python to run the regression analysis.

Here are the steps to calculate the beta of a stock using regression analysis:

Organize the historical price data for the stock and the market index in a spreadsheet.

Calculate the daily returns for the stock and the market index using the following formula:

Daily Return = (Price Today - Price Yesterday) / Price Yesterday

Calculate the covariance and variance of the stock returns and the market returns.

Use regression analysis to fit a line to the stock returns and the market returns.

The slope of the line represents the beta of the stock. If the slope of the line is greater than 1, the stock is more volatile than the market. If the slope of the line is less than 1, the stock is less volatile than the market.

It's important to remember that beta is just one measure of risk and should be used in conjunction with other measures of risk when evaluating an investment.




MACD VWAP RSI
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
EMAtoday = (Value Today​ ∗( Smoothing/1+Days​ ))+EMA Yesterday​ ∗(1−(Smoothing/ 1+Days​ )) smoothing = 2
EMA = Closing price x multiplier + EMA (previous day) x (1-multiplier)
